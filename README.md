= ODE - Open Data Exploration

This project is aimed at loading any kind of OpenData into an ElasticSearch instance (in different indexes), and then allow users o explore them using Kibana. 

First version is using Java for loading and parsing data and then sending it to ElasticSearch (simply because it was easier this way, but this may change in the future).
